# Chef.in

Chef.in is a web application that allows users to discover, share, and discuss culinary recipes.

## Development Process
The focus was mainly on frontend development, utilizing tools for recipe search and display.

Challenges were faced with version incompatibility between Node.js and Angular CLI, which slowed down the setup process. Additionally, there were issues with working with the Edamam API, primarily due to limited experience.

## Compromises and Known Issues
Due to time constraints, the decision was made to skip implementing pagination. Some known issues include instability in the search feature, requiring a page refresh for repeated searches.Also as i mentioned there can be issues with Edamam API.

Note: Make sure you have compatible versions of Node.js and Angular CLI installed.

## Setting Up and Running the Project
